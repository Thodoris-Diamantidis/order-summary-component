## My process

My proccess for this project is almost the same as any project that i start:

- First step was to define my html structure and make a starter CSS file so it will be easier later on to style the whole project
- Started of with adding a CSS resseter from (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
- Added some Custom variables to help me in this project(guided by the style-guide.md)
- Second step was to start styling for mobile-first
- Started styling untill i was happy with the result
- Went and did the responsiveness afterwards
- Third and last step was to perfect the styling

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

As always i love learning new thing and im up for any challenge!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me a ton by starting of my Css file on the right foot. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
